GPGPU-LOS
----------------------------------------

A project that batched line-of-sight (LOS) checks with nVidia CUDA, circa April 2008.

----------------------------------------
ABOUT
----------------------------------------

At first I intended to precompute LOS checks from of every point on a heightmap to every
other point, but the space requirements for standard heightmaps were impractical. So I
changed the focus to compute an LOS check from a single point to every other point on the
map.

The algorithm was first tested/debugged on a CPU, then with CUDA in a command line program,
then visualized with a viewer. The viewer showed the view-shed of all polygons visable
from the starting LOS point.

The project demonstrated that it was very feasible, and recommended even, to parrallelize
LOS checks on a GPU at runtime when needed, or at the very least given static terrain, to
precompute these checks for ever faster visualization later.

NOTES
----------------------------------------

nVidia CUDA API was very new at the time (v1.0)
Hardware used was a G80 GPU, GeForce 8800 GTX.

The original programs were compiled and run in Microsoft Visual Studio (C++) from 2008.

DirectX 9.0c was used for rendering in the viewer.

** It is very likely that significant conversion will be needed to build this with the
most recent Visual Studio IDEs.
